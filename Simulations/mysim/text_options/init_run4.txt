Number of Evolutionary Generations    = 100
Number of Evaluations                 = 1
Number of Iterations                  = 400
Number of Groups in a Population      = 80
Number of Agents per Group            = 20
Are solutions diploid?  (Y or N)      = N
Are groups heterogeneous? (Y or N)    = N
Is selection individual? (Y or N)     = N
Number Evolving populations           = 1 This has to be 1 for the time being

The following three parameters are for the evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm (emoo)
Number of Fitness Objectives          = 1
Tournament size                       = 2 Better not to touch this parameter
Type of dominance                     = minimise / minimise / minimise
The options are: minimise and maximise; Don't forget to put the "equal" sign in front of minimise/maximise; You need to have has many types as the number of objectives

Number of Genotypes Truncated         = 10 This works only for the roulette_wheel GA
Elite (Y/N)                           = Y  This works only for the roulette_wheel and tournament GA
Probability of Mutation               = 0.03
Probability of Recombination          = 0.3

Dump statistics every                 = 1
Dump genome every                     = 1

Choose dir name where to dump data    = /DATA/
Choose dir name where to dump genome  = /GENOME/

Choose type of evolutionary algorithm = tournament
(Current Options: tournament, roulette_wheel, emoo )

Choose type of control system         = ctrnn_three_layers
(Current Options: ctrnn_three_layers - ctrnn_three_layers_hebb - simple_three_layers - perceptron - elman - ctrnn_fully_recurrent - pfsm)
